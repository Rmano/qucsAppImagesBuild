## These are the GitHub pages for the AppImages for QUCS-0.0.20

Ok, this is basically a test. Let's see if I can manage it. This repository downloads the **QUCS-0.0.20-rc2** sources from
[the main repository](https://github.com/Qucs/qucs) and build an AppImage on Ubuntu 16.04 (the one provided by GitHub actions). 

The versions of AppImage will be available on the [release page](https://github.com/Rmano/qucsAppImagesBuild/releases).

Directlink to the [latest build 0.0.20-rc2 AppImage](https://github.com/Rmano/qucsAppImagesBuild/releases/download/v0.1/Qucs-0.0.20-pre2-x86_64.AppImage).

### Support or Contact

This thing is offered "as is" --- but if you have any idea to make this a better repository, please tell me. 

For now it will be updated manually when needed --- but my idea is to try to try to integrate it into the main QUCS repository.
